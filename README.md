High-Performance Distributed Key-Value Store
This project is a high-performance, distributed key-value store designed for efficient data storage and retrieval, optimized for sub-millisecond latency on reads and high throughput. It is implemented in Go, leveraging Protocol Buffers for efficient data serialization and gRPC for network communication. The system is designed to support configurable consistency levels and can handle large volumes of concurrent operations efficiently.

Features
Custom Storage Engine: Optimized for high throughput and low-latency access.
Lock-Free Data Structures: To ensure scalability with concurrent access.
Custom Memory Management: Efficient memory usage to minimize overhead.
Configurable Consistency Levels: Offers tunable consistency depending on use case (strong consistency, eventual consistency).
gRPC API: For easy interaction with the store over the network.
Performance Testing: Includes tests for read latency, write latency, and throughput under various load conditions.
Architecture
The project is structured as a distributed system with the following components:

Storage Engine: The heart of the key-value store, providing fast, scalable storage and retrieval.
API Layer: A simple HTTP/gRPC API to interact with the store.
Consistency Layer: Manages consistency across distributed nodes.
Test Suite: Includes a set of automated tests to ensure the system meets the required performance targets.
Performance Targets
Read Latency: < 1ms (p99)
Write Latency: < 5ms (p99)
Throughput: Minimum 100k ops/sec
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Go 1.18+ (Download from Go Official Website)
gRPC (For API communication)
Protocol Buffers compiler (Download from Protocol Buffers GitHub)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Tmwakalasya/HighPerformanceKVStore.git
cd HighPerformanceKVStore
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
Compile the Protocol Buffers files:

bash
Copy code
protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/*.proto
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
Running Tests
To run the test suite for the storage engine and other components, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
go test ./...
Running the Distributed System
To set up a distributed system:

Start multiple instances of the key-value store on different machines or in different terminals.
Configure the nodes to communicate using gRPC and manage distributed data.
Monitor the performance via logs to ensure the system meets the required latency and throughput targets.
API Endpoints
The key-value store provides a simple gRPC interface. Example API usage:

Set Key-Value Pair

Endpoint: /Set
Method: POST
Request Body: { "key": "user123", "value": "data123" }
Response: Success or error message
Get Value by Key

Endpoint: /Get
Method: GET
Request Parameters: key=user123
Response: { "value": "data123" }
Delete Key-Value Pair

Endpoint: /Delete
Method: DELETE
Request Body: { "key": "user123" }
Response: Success or error message
Performance Benchmarks
The key-value store has been optimized for high-performance use cases:

Sub-millisecond read latency under normal load.
High throughput even under stress conditions with concurrent access.
Custom memory management for efficient handling of large data sets.
Future Enhancements
Cluster Management: Add a more advanced cluster management layer to automatically handle node failures and rebalancing.
Compression: Implement data compression techniques to reduce storage overhead.
Consistency Models: Add more consistency models like causal consistency for complex applications.
Monitoring and Metrics: Integrate monitoring tools to track system health and performance metrics.
